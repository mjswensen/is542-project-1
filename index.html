    <h2>The Scala Programming Language</h2>
    <span>"Object-Oriented Meets Functional"</span>
    <hr>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Scala is a JVM-based language (i.e., compiles to Java bytecode) that fuses the features of modern programming languages to the ubiquity of Java-enabled platforms. From the <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org">official Scala website,</a> "Scala is a concise, elegant, type-safe programming language that integrates object-oriented and functional features."</p>
    <p>Here is a list of some of Scala's users:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>EDFT</li>
      <li>Twitter</li>
      <li>Novell</li>

      <li>Xebia</li>
      <li>Xerox</li>
      <li>FourSquare</li>
      <li>Sony</li>
      <li>Siemens</li>
      <li>Thatcham</li>
      <li>OPower</li>
      <li>GridGain</li>
      <li>AppJet</li>
      <li>Reaktor</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Scala began in 2001 as the brainchild of Martin Odersky, in Lausanne, Switzerland. A complete history of the language can be found at on the <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/239">Scala website's history page.</a></p>
    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <p>This document briefly overviews four of Scala's primary attractions and features:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Interoperability with Java</li>
      <li>Functional Programming</li>
      <li>Flexibility with Object Inheritance</li>
      <li>Extensibility</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Interoperability with Java</h4>
    <p>One of Scala's most powerful selling points is its compatibility with Java. Any Java code can be used within your Scala project! Because of Java's age and popularity, there are many high-quality Java libraries available. Scala can leverage these libraries.</p>
    <p>Support for the .NET framework is also available.</p>
    <h4>Functional Programming</h4>
    <p>Scala introduces functional programming paradigms to the object-oriented world. Functions, therefore are first-class citizens in the Scala world and can receive the same treatments as any other object (e.g., be assigned to variables, be passed to other functions as parameters, be returned from other functions, etc.).</p>
    <h4>Flexibility with Object Inheritance</h4>
    <p>Scala supports inheritance the way a programmer familiar with the classical paradigms would expect. However, Scala also supports much more flexible approaches to code reuse. For example, Scala utilizes <em>traits</em>, or bits of functionality that can be mixed in to various classes.</p>
    <h4>Extensibility</h4>
    <p>Scala is extensible in that programmers can extend the language to meet the needs of their project. For example, any method can be used as an infix operator, like so: <code>&lt;object&gt; &lt;methodname&gt; &lt;otherobject&gt;.</code></p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>There are hundreds of other features of Scala that are worth mentioning. For a comprehensive look at the language, see the book written by Scala's creators: "Programming in Scala" by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon, and Bill Venners.</p>
